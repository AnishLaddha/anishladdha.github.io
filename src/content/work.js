        During the summer of '23 I worked for the Artificial Intelligence Platform team out of Foster City, writing a program to optimize compute resources for Apache Spark jobs.
        I profiled their performance, then detected and squashed bottlenecks in resource (vram/vcore) allocations.

        I was on the Release Engineering team based out of Austin, where I worked on security fixes for various in-house softwares developed by the test automation teams. I removed a ton of hard coded credentials and integrated a variety of tools to follow secret management best practices. I also modified code to protect against attacks like buffer overflows.

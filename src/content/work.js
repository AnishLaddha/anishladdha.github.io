        During the summer of '23 I worked for the Artificial Intelligence Platform team out of Foster City, writing a program to optimize compute resources for Apache Spark jobs (mostly data processing and engineering). Working in python, I used <a href="https://github.com/qubole/sparklens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blue-link">Sparklens <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and past data to profile a variety of jobs, detected bottlenecks based on resources, and then assigned an amount of vcores/vram to eliminate those bottlenecks.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I created a <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="blue-link">Grafana <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> dashboard, powered by a Flask + SQL backend, to visualize all the data that this process generated. I was able to generate some pretty cool/insightful graphs. In fact, you could see some bottlenecks pop up, get detected, and get squashed in real time.

        I was on the Release Engineering team based out of Austin, where I worked on security fixes for various in-house softwares developed by the test automation teams. I removed a ton of hard coded credentials and integrated a variety of tools to follow secret management best practices. I also modified code to protect against attacks like buffer overflows.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In addition to security fixes, I got to write on a REST API in Java using the Springboot framework. The API enrolled projects from around the company into the CI/CD pipeline for the release engineering team to begin to work on. I integrated it with Jenkins to provide status updates, and wrote clean,modular code that could/would be expanded on.
